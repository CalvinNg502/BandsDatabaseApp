## Introduction

This application is a CRUD application designed for allowing the user to interface with a bands database. It is an html frontend using php and mysql in the backend.

## Launch

This code alone is insufficient to launch the project; it contains the html frontend and php backend, but it does not contain the sql code. Thus, this repository is very much 'look only.'

## Features
- Tables include bands, members, albums, and songs.
- Create new entries in tables.
- Read entries in tables.
- Update entries in tables.
- Delete entries in tables.

## Status

This project is complete. It is lacking in css, but it is functional. At some point, I may update this repository with the sql code for actually creating the tables and populating them with sample data.
